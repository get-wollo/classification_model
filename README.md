# classification_model
Model to predict the category of a product out of 20 amazon catagories using the image/title
Using metadata from Amazon, https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon_v2/index.html

85.7% accuracy using fasttext model with product title after careful cleaining 
Have processed the image dataset to be compatable with the industry leading Inception V3 model (training time is currently in the weeks, currently too expensive to train) but small data sample works
